It’s time to change the way Real Estate websites are built. Today’s WordPress page builders allow you to build beautiful custom websites, but when it comes to real estate websites, MLS/IDX data doesn’t work. [VistaWP](https://vistawp.com/) changes that by integrating MLS data with today’s most popular WordPress page builders.

## Features

### A Powerful Framework

VistaWP liberates your listings data and turns it into a powerful framework. Build custom-design templates with your favorite page builder, use different templates for different property types, and create unique user flows and experiences, all with up-to-date MLS data.

### Beautiful, Unique Designs

Anything you can build with a page builder, you can build with VistaWP. Each data point in MLS listings becomes a shortcode that you can add to any widget.

### Custom Search Forms and Results

Use the built-in search forms or numerous third-party form builders, like Formidable Forms and Fluent Forms, to create custom search forms and tailored results. Want a unique experience highlighting a specific part of town? No problem.

### Real SEO Power

Everyone knows that the best SEO means creating quality content. VistaWP allows you to build specific templates and incorporate listings into any content, whether it be a landing page, post, or anything else.

### Fast and Light

VistaWP is a trim plugin that minimizes bloat and server load. MLS data is served via RESO technology, which is great for SEO and for performance.

## How it Works 

1. **Install and use the plugin completely for free.** You can use the free dummy data as long as you need to develop your site.

2. **Download and import the free starter templates.** This will get you off to a great start! [Access them here.](https://vistawp.com/download/)

3. **Build and explore with dummy data built-in.** The free VistaWP plugin will show dummy real estate data right out of the box. That way you can experiment and build out your site before purchasing a subscription.

4. **Purchase a subscription and connect your MLS.** Once you’re ready to start using your MLS data, sign up for a subscription to VistaWP, and fill out the form with your MLS credentials. Our team will map your MLS Data to the plugin. This process takes 3-5 business days.

5. **Launch Your Site!** The site you built using dummy data will be populated with live data from your MLS! Launch time!
